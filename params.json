{"name":"Mr. Advice","tagline":".NET aspect weaver","body":"# Summary\r\n\r\nMr. Advice is an open source (and free of charge) alternative to PostSharp (which is still far more advanced, see https://www.postsharp.net).  \r\nIt intends to inject aspects at build-time. Advices are written in the form of attributes, and marking methods with them makes the pointcut, resulting in a nice and easy aspect injection.  \r\nMore information about what is an aspect at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming).  \r\n\r\nMrAdvice can weave assemblies for:\r\n\r\n* .NET framework (4 and above)\r\n* Mono\r\n* Silverlight (4 & 5)\r\n* Windows Phone (8 and above)\r\n\r\n# How it works\r\n\r\nIt is available as a NuGet package (https://www.nuget.org/packages/MrAdvice.Fody)\r\n\r\n# Philosophy\r\n\r\nCurrently, MrAdvice won't bring you any aspect out-of-the-box.\r\nThis means you'll have to write your own aspects.  \r\nSo it brings us to the next chapter, which is...\r\n\r\n# How to implement your own aspects\r\n\r\n## In a nutshell\r\n\r\nHere is the minimal sample:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class MyProudAdvice : Attribute, IMethodAdvice\r\n{\r\n    public void Advise(MethodAdviceContext context)\r\n    {\r\n        // do things you want here\r\n        context.Proceed(); // this calls the original method\r\n        // do other things here\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou then just need to mark the method(s) with the attribute and that's it, your aspect is injected!\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[MyProudAdvice]\r\npublic void MyProudMethod()\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## More details\r\n\r\nYour aspects can be injected at assembly, type or method level, simply by setting the attribute:\r\n\r\n* When an aspect is injected at asembly level, all methods of all types are weaved.\r\n* When the aspect is injected at type level, all of its methods are weaved.\r\n* And of course, if the aspect is injected on a method, only the method is weaved.\r\n\r\n# Some disclaimer \r\n(almost hidden at the almost end of this almost interesting readme)\r\n\r\nMrAdvice exposes an API (such as `IAdvice`, `IMethodAdvice`, etc.), which is subject to change until we reach the version 1.0.  \r\nOf course, there shouldn't be any structural change, but methods might be renamed, or parameters changed if we need it to improve the product.\r\n\r\n# Contact and links\r\n\r\nProject owner is [picrap](https://github.com/picrap), feel free to drop a mail :email:.  \r\nProject company is [Arx One](http://arxone.com), a french company editor of backup software solutions.  \r\n","google":"UA-60253103-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
